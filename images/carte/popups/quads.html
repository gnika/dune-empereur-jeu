		<h3>Old Well</h3> 
		<div class="popupcontent"> 
			<p>The Old Well, modeled on the Temple of Love in the Gardens of Versailles, is the most enduring symbol of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. A small, neoclassical rotunda, the Old Well is located in front of the South Building in the historic North Campus. Originally, the well was located a few meters west of its present location, near Old East dormitory. The original location can be identified by a circular area of sunken bricks in the sidewalk. The well has become the most enduring symbol of the university, serving as its unofficial logo.</p>
